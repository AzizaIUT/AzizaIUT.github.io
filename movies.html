<p>Harry Potter is a British-American film series based on the Harry Potter novels by author J. K. Rowling. The series is distributed by Warner Bros. and consists of eight fantasy films, beginning with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) and culminating with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011).[2][3]

The series was mainly produced by David Heyman, and stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as the three leading characters: Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Four directors worked on the series: Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuaron, Mike Newell, and David Yates.[4] All eight movies had their screenplays written by Steve Kloves, with the exception of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007), written by Michael Goldenberg. Production took over ten years to complete, with the main story arc following Harry Potter's quest to overcome his arch-enemy Lord Voldemort.[5]

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final novel in the series, was adapted into two feature-length parts.[6] Part 1 was released in November 2010, and Part 2 was released in July 2011.[7][8]

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the only film in the series not among the 50 highest-grossing films, with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, the highest-grossing film in the series and one of 26 films to gross over $1 billion, ranking at number 8.[9] Without inflation adjustment, it is the second highest-grossing film series with $7.7 billion in worldwide receipts.</p>

<p>The Lord of the Rings (also promoted as The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy) is a film series consisting of three high fantasy adventure films directed by Peter Jackson. They are based on the novel The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. The films are subtitled The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003). They were distributed by New Line Cinema.

Considered to be one of the biggest and most ambitious film projects ever undertaken, with an overall budget of $281 million (some sources say $310-$330 million),[3] the entire project took eight years, with the filming for all three films done simultaneously and entirely in New Zealand, Jackson's native country.[4] Each film in the series also had special extended editions released on DVD a year after their respective theatrical releases. While the films follow the book's general storyline, they do omit some of the novel's plot elements and include some additions to and deviations from the source material.

Set in the fictional world of Middle-earth, the films follow the hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) as he and a Fellowship embark on a quest to destroy the One Ring, and thus ensure the destruction of its maker, the Dark Lord Sauron (Sala Baker). The Fellowship becomes divided and Frodo continues the quest together with his loyal companion Sam (Sean Astin) and the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis). Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), heir in exile to the throne of Gondor, and the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) unite and rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth in the War of the Ring.

The series was a major financial success, with the films collectively being among the highest-grossing film series of all time. The films were critically acclaimed and heavily awarded, winning 17 out of 30 total Academy Award nominations. The final film in the series, The Return of the King, won all of its 11 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, which also tied it with Ben-Hur and Titanic for most Academy Awards received for a film. The series received wide praise for its innovative special and visual effects.</p>

<p>The Hobbit is a film series consisting of three high fantasy adventure films directed by Peter Jackson. They are based on the 1937 novel The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien, with large portions of the trilogy inspired by the appendices to The Return of the King, which expand on the story told in The Hobbit, as well as new material and characters written especially for the films. Together they act as a prequel to Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. The films are subtitled An Unexpected Journey (2012), The Desolation of Smaug (2013), and The Battle of the Five Armies (2014).[4]

The screenplay was written by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Jackson, and Guillermo del Toro, who was originally chosen to direct before his departure from the project. The films take place in the fictional world of Middle-earth sixty years before the beginning of The Lord of the Rings, and follow hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), who is convinced by the wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) to accompany thirteen dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), on a quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch). The films also expand upon certain elements from the novel and other source material, such as Gandalf's investigation at Dol Guldur, and the pursuit of Azog and Bolg, who seek vengeance against Thorin and his ancestors.

The films feature an ensemble cast that also includes James Nesbitt, Ken Stott, Evangeline Lilly, Lee Pace and Luke Evans, with several actors reprising their roles from The Lord of the Rings, including Cate Blanchett, Orlando Bloom, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Elijah Wood and Andy Serkis. The films also feature Manu Bennett, Sylvester McCoy, Stephen Fry, Mikael Persbrandt, Barry Humphries, and Lawrence Makoare. Also returning for production, among others, were illustrators John Howe and Alan Lee, art director Dan Hennah, cinematographer Andrew Lesnie, and composer Howard Shore, while props were again crafted by Weta Workshop, with visual effects managed by Weta Digital.

The first film in the series premiered at the Embassy Theatre in Wellington, New Zealand on 28 November 2012. One hundred thousand people lined the red carpet on Courtenay Place, and the entire event was broadcast live on television in New Zealand and streamed over the Internet. The second film of the series premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California on 2 December 2013. The third and final film premiered at Leicester Square in London on 1 December 2014.[5] </p>

<h1> Testament of youth</h1>

<p>The film starts with the image of a cheering crowd, celebrating the end of the war in 1918. Vera Brittain goes through the crowd, the only one not cheering, and ends up in a church, where several women are praying.

In 1914 Vera fights to become a student at Somerville College, Oxford. While her father is against it, her brother Edward supports her, along with his close friend Roland Leighton, and their friend Victor. Together the "three musketeers" and Vera have a good summer, swimming in a lake together and having long walks in the nature. Roland, who is himself an aspiring poet, supports Vera in writing her own poems and pursuing her dream of becoming a writer someday. Roland and Vera start a shy romance. With the support of her brother Vera convinces her father to let her visit Oxford. The First World War breaks out and all three musketeers enlist. Vera convinces her father to let Edward join the army. When she arrives in Oxford she sees, for the first time, two amputees. In a newspaper Vera sees that four of the five pages of the paper are only the names of the fallen. Vera volunteers to join the Voluntary Aid Detachment as a nurse tending the wounded in a hospital. The other nurses know that she is from Oxford and therefore try to "break" Vera. For the first time Vera is confronted with the wounded from the front, when she has to wash a stinking soldier, who laid in his mud and blood from the battlefield in Flanders to the hospital in London. Roland comes back on home leave and is traumatised by his experiences at the front. After a talk with Vera he proposes to her and they decide to get married on his next home leave. They have a good day together after which Roland has to get back to France, this time accompanied by Vera's brother Edward. Vera's father has a breakdown after his son leaves. In the hospital an evergrowing stream of wounded soldiers arrive. Roland writes that he has been granted a leave on Christmas, and has been sent far behind the lines and is safe. He gets killed shortly before that. Vera finds out that he did not die "bravely and painlessly", as the letter she receives from the Army states. Due to a lack of morphine he suffered a long time in a hospital in France, shot in the abdomen. Her friend Victor is blinded by a gas attack and gets to the hospital. Vera proposes to him, so they "can take care of each other", but he refuses, although he has been in love with Vera for a long time. The next night he dies. Vera decides to go work in France herself. Her father is very proud of her. It's August 1917 and in France the situation of the wounded is very bad. Due to a lack of surgeons often the nurses have to perform amputations. Vera works in a hospital behind the frontlines, where she is first tasked with treating wounded Germans. Although she and her superior at first seem to not care much about the wounded enemy, they later both comfort a dying German soldier. After a big offensive the hospital is so crowded that the wounded have to lay in the mud outside. In a huge pile of corpses Vera discovers her brother, who is still alive. His infected wound gets treatment and he is saved. After that he is sent to Italy, which seems to be good news, because the fighting there is lighter. Edward wants Vera to proceed her academic career after the war, by visiting Oxford. Vera's mother has a nervous breakdown and Vera goes home. There she takes over the households, by cleaning the house and hiring a maid. Edward gets killed at the front in Italy. The day of the truce comes. Like in the first minutes of the movie, Vera is shown as she marches stoically through a cheering crowd, to end up in a church where some women are praying. Honouring her brother's wish Vera finally goes to Oxford, where she has nightmares about Roland's and Edward's death. Winifried Holtby, another student at the college, helps her cope with her trauma and to get back into the world. At a political discussion, about whether to punish or to forgive the Germans, most of the audience is for a "revenge treaty". George Catlin , who calls for a "forgiving piece" is booed upon. Vera gets on the stage and holds a speech about how she held the hand of a dying German soldier and that he was not different from her brother or her fiance. Therefore she calls for a "No more" to war and revenge.</p>
